# Common Lisp API examples

These examples are designed to work with Steel Bank Common Lisp
<http::/sbcl.org>. They should work out of the box on MacOS with the
standard framework install locations. On linux, a "libcsound64.so" symlink to libcsound
should exist in the working directory. For Windows, the code can be
edited to reflect the location of the Csound64.dll library file.
