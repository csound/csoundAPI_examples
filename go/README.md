# Csound 6 - Go API Examples

This folder contains examples for using the Csound API in Go. They start with a minimal usage of Csound and each example afterwards builds upon the previous one.  There are numerous comments in each file to explain what is new in the example as well as explain how the new things may be used. 

## Useful Notes

* It is assumed that you have installed the go-csnd6 package from "https://github.com/fggp/go-csnd6".
* To run an example, in a terminal, type "go run" followed by the example file. For example, to run example01.go, use "go run example01.go".
