// Example 5 - Generating Score
// Adapted for golang by Francois Pinot <fggpinot@gmail.com>, 2013.11.15,
// from the original python example by Steven Yi <stevenyi@gmail.com>
//
// In this example, we will look at three techniques for generating our Score.
//
// The first is one we have already seen, which is to just write out the score
// by hand as a String.
//
// Knowing that we pass strings into Csound to pass note events, we can also
// generate the string. In the second example, sco2 starts as an empty string.
// Using a for-loop, we append to sco2 note strings using a string formatting
// string that has its replacement values replaced. The replace values are
// calculated using the i value, and the result is an ascending note line.
//
// In the final example, we are going to generate a list of lists. The top-level
// list represents our score as a whole, and each sub-list within it represents
// the data for a single note. The main list is then processed in two ways: first,
// it processes each sub-list and joins the values together into a single note string;
// second, it joins each individual note string into a single, large score string,
// separated by newlines. The end result is a sequence of 13 notes with random
// pitches.
//
// The final example represents a common pattern of development. For systems that
// employ some event-based model of music, it is common to use some kind of data
// structure to represent events. This may use some kind of common data structure
// like a list, or it may be represented by using a class and instances of that
// class.
//
// Note, the three examples here are indicated with comments. To listen to the examples,
// look for the lines that have c.ReadScore(sco) (lines 80-82), uncomment the one
// you want to hear, and comment out the others.

	sco3 = strings.Join(vals, "\n")
	//	fmt.Println(vals)
	//	fmt.Println(sco3)

	c.ReadScore(sco) // Read in Score from pre-written String
	//c.ReadScore(sco2) // Read in Score from loop-generated String
	//c.ReadScore(sco3) // Read in Score from loop-generated String

	c.Start() // When compiling from strings, this call is necessary before doing any performing

	// The following is our main performance loop. We will perform one block of sound at a time
	// and continue to do so while it returns 0, which signifies to keep processing.
