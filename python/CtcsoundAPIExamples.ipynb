    "This example introduces using Csound's Channel System to communicate continuous control data (k-rate) from a host program to Csound. The first thing to note is the RandomLine class. It takes in a base value and a range in which to vary randomly.  The reset functions calculates a new random target value (self.end), a random duration in which to run (self.dur, expressed as # of audio blocks to last in duration), and calculates the increment value to apply to the current value per audio-block.  When the target is met, the Randomline will reset itself to a new target value and duration. \n",

    "In this example, we use two RandomLine objects, one for amplitude and another for frequency.  We start a Csound instrument instance that reads from two channels using the chnget opcode. In turn, we update the values to the channel from the host program.  In this case, because we want to keep our values generating in sync with the audio engine, we use a while-loop instead of a CsoundPerformanceThread. To update the channel, we call the SetChannel method on the Csound object, passing a channel name and value.  \n",

    "## Example 8 - More Efficient Channel Communications\n",
    "This example builds on Example 7 by replacing the calls to SetChannel with using GetChannelPtr. In the Csound API, using SetChannel and GetChannel is great for quick work, but ultimately it is slower than pre-fetching the actual channel pointer.  This is because Set/GetChannel operates by doing a lookup of the Channel Pointer, then setting or getting the value.  This happens on each call. The alternative is to use channelPtr, which fetches the Channel Pointer and lets you directly set and get the value on the pointer.  When a pointer is returned by a function of the API, ctcsound encapsulates this pointer in an ndarray (numpy array). Once the pointer is connected to the array, values can be written directly into the array through the channel."
