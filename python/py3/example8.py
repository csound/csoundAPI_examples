# Example 8 - More efficient Channel Communications

#
# This example builds on Example 7 by replacing the calls to SetChannel
# with using GetChannelPtr. In the Csound API, using SetChannel and GetChannel
# is great for quick work, but ultimately it is slower than pre-fetching the
# actual channel pointer.  This is because Set/GetChannel operates by doing a 
# lookup of the Channel Pointer, then setting or getting the value.  This 
# happens on each call. The alternative is to use GetChannelPtr, which fetches
# the Channel Pointer and lets you directly set and get the value on the pointer.
#
# In C/C++/Objective-C, one can directly use MYFLT* to get/set values.  However,
# for wrapped languages such as Python, Java, and Lua, it is generally not possible
# to get/set the value on the pointer itself.  The Csound API for host languages 
# uses a special wrapper object called CsoundMYFLTArray, which will hold a reference
# to a MYFLT*.  The CsoundMYFLTArray in turn has convenience methods for setting
# and getting values. 
#
# The code below shows how to use the CsoundMYFLTArray in conjunction with GetChannelPtr
# to have a more optimized channel setting system.
