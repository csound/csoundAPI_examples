# Csound 6 - Groovy API Examples
Author: Steven Yi <stevenyi@gmail.com>

This folder contains examples for using the Csound API in Groovy (http://groovy.codehaus.org). They start with a minimal usage of Csound and each example afterwards builds upon the previous one.  There are numerous comments in each file to explain what is new in the example as well as explain how the new things may be used. 

Note: These examples were translated from the Java examples.

## Useful Notes

* Each example is written within their own Example.groovy file
* Each example can be run using the "groovy" command-line script.  For example, to run example 1, use "groovy Example1.groovy".
* These examples use the Java API from Groovy. The functions with the Java API do not have the same documentation as is found in the original C API or C++ API's.  It is recommended to lookup further information from the Csound header files, found in "csound6/include/csound.h" and "csound6/include/csound.hpp" respectively.
