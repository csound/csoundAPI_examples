The examples in this directory demonstrate how to use the Csound API version 6.x. The examples in Python were used for the 2nd International Csound Conference, at the two-part session "How to Use the Csound API".  These examples were further developed since then, and have been translated into other languages. 

Each language folder should have its own README.md that will explain futher details on how to run the examples.  Also, each example file is commented to explain what the example illustrates.
