### Csound-API / XCode project. 

This project assumes that a recent version of Csound has been installed using the standard Csound installer on OSX. Therefore it expects to find the Csound framework in:

```/Library/Frameworks```

And the Csound header files in:

```/Library/Frameworks/CsoundLib64.framework/Headers```

If you have a custom build of Csound, or have installed it to a different location, you will need to update the project options.
